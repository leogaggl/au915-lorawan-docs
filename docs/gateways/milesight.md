# Milesight LoRaWAN Gateways

Milesight manufactures a series of standard LoRaWAN and two models of Helium gateways (with 32GB MMC storage).

There is separate firmware releases for Helium based units - **do not use standard firmware on Helium gateways and vice versa**.

For the purposes of this documentation we will only deal with UG65 and UG65H versions. All other gateways are the same in firmware and UI.

## Standard LoRaWAN
All Milesight 915MHz gateway variants support AU915 (all sub-bands).

### Milesight gateway variants

- UG56 - Industrial Gateway (DIN-rail mount)
- UG63 - Mini gateway for indoor and testing applications
- UG65 - Semi-industrial (IP65) for indoor and protected areas
- UG67 - Outdoor (IP67) gateway

## Helium Gateways

Unlike the standard LoRaWAN gateways above SSH access (prior to Firmware 61.0.0.37) requires you to contact Milesight support with your Serial number.

### Milesight Helium gateway variants

- UG65H - Semi-industrial (IP65) for indoor and protected areas
- UG67H - Outdoor (IP67) gateway

### Re-purposing Helium gateways on other LoRaWAN networks

Unlike a lot of other Helium manufacturers Milesight gateways can be easily changed via the normal Web Admin UI or remote managment.
Just disable the Helium forwarder and add another forwarder.
